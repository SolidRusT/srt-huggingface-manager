# srt-hf-repo-fixer Development Manual

## Opening prompt

```plaintext
Let's start the next development cycle for srt-hf-repo-fixer. My @Codebase  is updated. Review the current status of the project by cross-referencing the ROADMAP.md file. Identify any pending tasks, upcoming milestones, or potential roadblocks. After this review, suggest a prioritized list of actions or enhancements to focus on for this cycle, ensuring that everything aligns with the project's goals and timelines. If there are any updates needed in the ROADMAP.md file based on recent progress, highlight those as well.
```

## Let's proceed

```plaintext
My @Codebase  is updated. Based on our discussion so far, immediately start executing the first step in the plan we've outlined. Summarize the key points we've covered as you proceed, and ensure that each step aligns with the goals outlined in the ROADMAP.md file. Provide updates as you complete each step, and only stop to discuss if you encounter an issue that needs clarification or decision-making. Let's make tangible progress towards our objectives.
```

## End Cycle

```plaintext
Let's wrap up this development cycle. My @Codebase  is updated. Please provide a summary of the tasks we've completed, any milestones we've achieved, and any unresolved issues or pending tasks that need to be carried over to the next cycle. Ensure that all progress and updates are reflected in the ROADMAP.md file. Finally, suggest any retrospective insights or improvements we should consider for the next cycle to enhance our workflow and project alignment.
```

## Scenarios

Here are additional scenarios that might be encountered when using an AI to develop all the code:

---

### **Identify and Prioritize Bugs**

```plaintext
My @Codebase  is updated. Let's review any bugs or issues that have been identified during this cycle. Please list them in order of priority, along with potential solutions or workarounds. Ensure that the most critical issues are addressed first, and update the ROADMAP.md file to reflect these priorities. If any new bugs or issues have emerged that require attention, make sure they are documented and suggest how we should incorporate their resolution into our development plan.
```

---

### **Feature Planning and Brainstorming**

```plaintext
My @Codebase  is updated. We need to plan and brainstorm new features for srt-hf-repo-fixer. Review the existing feature set and suggest new features or improvements based on the project's goals and user feedback. Consider how these ideas align with our current priorities in the ROADMAP.md file. Once we've discussed potential features, propose a plan for implementing them, including estimated timelines and any potential challenges.
```

---

### **Code Review and Refactoring**

```plaintext
My @Codebase  is updated. Let's conduct a code review for the recent changes and identify any areas that may require refactoring. Highlight any technical debt or areas where the code could be optimized for performance, maintainability, or scalability. Ensure that these improvements align with our overall goals and update the ROADMAP.md file if any significant refactoring tasks need to be scheduled. Suggest a plan to address these in the next cycle or ongoing development.
```

---

### **Integration and Testing**

```plaintext
My @Codebase  is updated. We've developed new features or made significant changes. Now, let's focus on integration and testing. Identify any areas that require thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. If there are any testing gaps, suggest a plan to address them. Ensure that all new code integrates seamlessly with existing functionality and that we maintain alignment with the ROADMAP.md file.
```

---

### **Deployment Planning**

```plaintext
My @Codebase  is updated. We're ready to plan the deployment of our latest changes. Review the current state of the project and propose a deployment strategy that minimizes risk and ensures smooth roll-out. Identify any dependencies, configurations, or final checks that need to be completed before deployment. Once ready, outline the deployment steps and ensure everything aligns with our goals and the ROADMAP.md file.
```

---

### **Handle Unexpected Challenges**

```plaintext
My @Codebase  is updated. We've encountered an unexpected challenge or roadblock. Let's assess the situation and determine the best course of action. Review our current progress and goals, and suggest possible solutions or workarounds. Ensure that any adjustments to our plan are reflected in the ROADMAP.md file, and help us realign our strategy to stay on track despite this challenge.
```

---

### **Request for Feedback and Iteration**

```plaintext
My @Codebase  is updated. Let's gather feedback on the recent changes or features we've implemented. Review the user feedback or test results and suggest any necessary iterations or improvements. Ensure that these feedback-driven changes align with the goals in the ROADMAP.md file and propose a plan for incorporating them into our ongoing development cycle.
```

---

### **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**

```plaintext
My @Codebase  is updated. Let's ensure all our recent work is well-documented. Review the current state of the project's documentation and identify any gaps or areas that need updating. Suggest a plan for creating or refining documentation, ensuring it accurately reflects the latest changes and aligns with our overall goals. Make sure any updates are also noted in the ROADMAP.md file.
